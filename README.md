## VoterTurnout GitHub Page

This readme file is written to explain this document and show you how to run its files.

## How to Run these Files
After downloading the files, users will need to download several packages including here, janitor, tidyverse, tidymodels, gt, gtExtras, ggfortify, and quantreg. Depending on where the files are saved, users may need to update the data_path object listed at the top of the files.

## Data
This file includes the final dataset complete_data.csv. This includes the total votes cast within state, the total voting population, as well as covariates and demographic controls of interest.

## Wrangling.R
